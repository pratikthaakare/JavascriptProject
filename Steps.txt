1. I created a repo on Github website directly. 
2. Created a file directly in the repo and pasted code block on it and merge it in main. 
3. merge request accepted. all done. 
4. created a different branch for coding and committing purposes called as "UntestedCode" in repo "JavascriptProject" in Github.
5. Pasted a small codeblock in  "UntestedCode" branch and saved it. 
6. Opened vs code on macbook, navigated to Documements via terminal in VSCODE, created a folder named "Untested Code" and cloned "JavascriptProject" from github. 
7. Executed code . and new instance of vscode has opened within "UntestedCode" from documents. 
8. So Turns out, you cant execute js file in vscode terminal, so you have to execute in a browser--developers settings--consoleTab to check if its working or not. 
9. I pushed the code using UI of VS code and then check inside Github, all good.
10.I am trying to push changes in steps.txt to check the workings on Git
